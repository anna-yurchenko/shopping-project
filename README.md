# ShoppingListProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

This project is a model of an online shop where you can create a user profile with the option of editing your personal information later on, browse through the shop, add items to your shopping cart and modify its contents whenever needed. It was created using **Angular**, **Angular Material** and **Firebase**.

This project was intended to help me better understand how to work with Angular, learn more of its features and get some practice with creating a more elaborate project, as well as help me learn the basics of working with Firebase.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
